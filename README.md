# Time-Travel Zine
I am learning Git by creating a time-travel-themed zine that explores creative collaboration between authors and editors.


## .gitignore
We ignore system and build files like `.DS_Store`, `target/`, and `node_modules/` so the repository stays clean and only contains relevant source code.

# Time-Travel Zine
I am learning Git by creating a time-travel-themed zine that explores creative collaboration between authors and editors.


## .gitignore
We ignore system and build files like `.DS_Store`, `target/`, and `node_modules/` so the repository stays clean and only contains relevant source code.


## Branch Usage
- **author/idea-sprint** — used for drafting and adding new ideas or story content.
- **editor/review** — used for reviewing, refining, and polishing the zine before merging to main.
Added contributor acknowledgment section.
